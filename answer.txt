Problem with protocol in Fig 1:
Client has no idea what message it is supposed to expect from Server, thus there is no way to check that the result is correct.
Server should encrypt the initial message sent by client with its private key, then send the encrypted message to the client.
After the client receives the encrypted message and obtained the server's public key, if the decrypted message matches the initial message sent to server, then check succeeded.
